Covid-19 Tracker App

Synopsis:

Our Covid-19 Tracker app will be used for current data in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will have an interactive page, where you can click on a certain location, that will be prompted with an events trigger for  the current Covid-19 data.  We will display global covid statistics on the forefront of the page, and will also have a navigation bar, where the user can read about Covid-19 facts, find local test sites etc. There is a data baseline that will be displayed, for any country that is submitted in the search bar. Should the United States  be prompted in the search bar, a more in-depth data report will be shown for any selected state. All the information will be dynamically pulled, and the database will be  constantly updating every ten minutes in order to keep the information and statistics current.
