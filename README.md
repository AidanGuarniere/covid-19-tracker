# Covid-19 Tracker

A user-friendly website that provides users with informational resources on Covid-19, testing reccomendations and directions, and an interactive map. The interactive map  displays the United States in a way that visually catalogues each state's number of active cases of Covid-19, and allows users to search each state via click/touch features, through fetch requests to a seperate server side API that delivers more in-depth information about that state's Covid-19 status. This information is sourced from John Hopkins University.
