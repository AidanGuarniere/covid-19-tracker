        <h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>
        <p>The main way the virus is spread between people is by those who are in close contact, within 6ft of space to one another. The spreading is caused by Cough aerosols.
Cough aerosols (respiratory droplets) are small airborne particles that carry pathogens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. It can also be spread through surface contact. Cough aerosols droplets can land on surfaces, and can be passed through the eyes, mouth, and nose if came into contact with said surface. 
Another form of transmission is airborne. If a person inhales air released from someone who is infected with Covid19, those airborne particles can linger in the for minutes to up to hours after. (This depends on the air flow circulation of the area.)
