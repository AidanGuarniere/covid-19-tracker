        How it spreads:
The main way the virus is spread between people is by those who are in close contact, within 6ft of space to one another. The spreading is caused by Cough aerosols.
Cough aerosols (respiratory droplets) are small airborne particles that carry pathogens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. It can also be spread through surface contact. Cough aerosols droplets can land on surfaces, and can be passed through the eyes, mouth, and nose if came into contact with said surface. 
Another form of transmission is airborne. If a person inhales  who is infected with Covid19 releases cough aerosols, those particles or can linger in the air for minutes to hours after. (This depends on the air flow circulation of the area.)
