        <h4>HOW IT SPREADS</h4>
        <p>The main way the virus is spread between people is by those who are in close contact, within 6ft of space to
            one another. The spreading is caused by Cough aerosols.
            Cough aerosols (respiratory droplets) are small airborne particles that carry pathogens when an infected
            person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. It can also be spread through surface contact. Cough
            aerosols droplets can land on surfaces, and can be passed through the eyes, mouth, and nose if came into
            contact with said surface.
            Another form of transmission is airborne. If a person inhales air released from someone who is infected with
            Covid19, those airborne particles can linger in the for minutes to up to hours after. (This depends on the
            air flow circulation of the area.)
