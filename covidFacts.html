        How it spreads:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The main way the virus is spread between people is by those who are in close contact, within 6ft of space to one
        another. The spreading is caused by Cough aerosols.
        Cough aerosols (respiratory droplets) are small airborne particles that carry pathogens when an infected person
        coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. It can also be spread through surface contact. Cough aerosols
        droplets can land on surfaces, and can be passed through the eyes, mouth, and nose if came into contact with
        said surface.
        Another form of transmission is airborne. If a person inhales who is infected with Covid19 releases cough
        aerosols, those particles or can linger in the air for minutes to hours after. (This depends on the air flow
        circulation of the area.)
